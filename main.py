'''
We can make this app even more comprehensive by - 
1. Adding QCÂ checks for vehicle numbers entered to ensure they fit the standard RTO patterns.
2. We can create a user-friendly web app for this using a Python framework like Django or Flask. 
3. We can use a database like MySQL or MongoDB to store other details of the vehicles.
